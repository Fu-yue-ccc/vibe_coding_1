## Course Description

In the last few years, large language models have introduced a revolutionary new paradigm in software development. The traditional software development lifecycle is being transformed by AI automation at every stage, raising the question: how should the next generation of software engineers leverage these advances to 10x their productivity and prepare for their careers?

This course demonstrates that modern AI tooling will not only enhance developer productivity but also democratize software engineering for a broader audience. We'll show that software development has evolved from 0-1 code creation to an iterative workflow of plan, generate with AI, modify, and repeat. Students will master both the theory behind traditional software engineering challenges and the cutting-edge AI-powered tools solving them today.

Through hands-on engineering tasks and talks from industry pioneers building these revolutionary tools, you'll gain practical experience with AI-assisted development, automated testing, intelligent documentation, and security vulnerability detection. By the end of this course, you'll have a crisp understanding of how to integrate state-of-the-art LLM models into complex development workflows and avoid common pitfalls.
